"""
3a. Create a new directory named "test_ex3". 
In this directory, create a file named "test_simple.py". 
In this file, write two simple functions "my_add" and "my_mul" 
which add two values together and multiply two values together respectively 
(and then return these values).

3b. Create two test functions "test_my_add" and "test_my_mul". 
These test functions should assert that the appropriate values are returned 
by "my_add" and "my_mul". Run your tests using "py.test -s -v test_simple.py".

3c. Modify one of your assert statements to intentionally cause py.test to fail. 
Execute "py.test" again and view the failed test.

3d. Fix the assert statement that you intentionally broke in the previous step. 
Verify your tests now all pass successfully.
