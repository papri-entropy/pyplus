1a. Copy the "fixme_orig.py" and the "my_devices.py" files from this week's course repository. 
Execute this "fixme_orig.py" code. It should successfully run and should print out NAPALM device facts. 
While the code is functional, there are some Python-style issues it.

1b. Run pylint against this "fixme_orig.py" file. 
Create a copy of fixme_orig.py; name the new file fixme_pylint.py. 
Fix all of the Pylint errors that are in this fixme_pylint.py file.

1c. Run pycodestyle against "fixme_orig.py". 
Create a copy of fixme_orig.py; name the new file fixme_pep8.py. 
Fix all of the pycodestyle errors that are in this fixme_pep8.py file.

1d. Run pylama against the "fixme_pep8.py" file. 
At this point, Pylama should report no errors. 
Note that by default, Pylama will run pycodestyle against your code. 
Consequently, you should see similar warnings and errors as you did when executing pycodestyle. 
Pylama, however, also supports additional linters which can potentially identify other issues.
